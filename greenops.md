# Absolutely not!

By working on the environmental impact of our applications, we can also:

- **Reduce costs** for hosting and data transfer
- **Improve performance** and user experience
- **Improve SEO** and visibility
- **Improve security** and compliance
- **Improve the reputation** of our brand

# But at the beginning...

...we were talking about GreenOps.

Of course, all the optimizations we have seen are part of the GreenOps philosophy.

Because GreenOps is not just about reducing the environmental impact of our cloud, but also depends on how we build and manage our applications.

But there is also also a lot of work to do on the infrastructure side.

# Reducing the infrastructure bundle size

let's take a look at the Dockerfile of a Node.js application for example.

````md magic-move
```dockerfile{*|1}
FROM node:22

COPY . .

RUN npm install

CMD ["node", "index.js"]
```

```dockerfile{1|*|5}
FROM node:22-slim ' use a distroless or slim image ' 

COPY . .

RUN npm install

CMD ["node", "index.js"]
```

```dockerfile{5|*|3}
FROM node:22-slim

COPY . .

RUN npm install --production ' install only production dependencies '

CMD ["node", "index.js"]
```

```dockerfile{3,7}
FROM node:22-slim

COPY package.json package-lock.json ./ 

RUN npm install --production

COPY src/ ./ ' copy only the things we need '

CMD ["node", "index.js"]
```
````

# Infrastructure optimization

<v-clicks>

- Relies on **CDN** to serve and cache images and videos closer to the user
- Use **Serverless** to scale only when needed (AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, etc.) 
- Monitor and optimize the **energy consumption** and **usage** of the cloud resources
- Select the right **data center** and **region** based on the demand and the energy consumption
- Seek for alternative projects (f.e. we moved from **Pulsar** to **NATS** and we have reduced the load for about **50%**)

# Dear developers...

...it's time to sleep well!

Let's be honest, how much do we waste on keeping our applications up and running 24/7 in a development environment?

We can use tools like **Kubernetes** to scale our applications based on the demand and reduce the resources used when they are not needed.

**Knative**, **Horizontal Pod Autoscaling**, and **KubeGreen** can help us to reduce the energy consumption on a Kubernetes cluster.

Also, **FinOps** tools can help us to reduce all the waste in the cloud.

# In conclusion...

... I know that it's not easy to change the way we work and the way we build our applications.

But we can start with small steps and small changes, and we can make a big difference.

We can't change the world in one day, but we can start to make it better.
